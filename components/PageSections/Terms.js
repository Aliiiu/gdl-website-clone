              If you leave your Electronic Access Device without logging out,

              We will always use all reasonable efforts to keep the App and

              further down. However, if these issues arise due to carelessness
              with any part of your app or account security, there is very
              little we can do, and we will be relieved of any liability as

              then investigate and report back to you through the most secure
