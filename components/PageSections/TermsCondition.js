            following:

          <ol className="my-2 list-decimal list-inside">

              Ensure that your Security Details, PIN, and any part of your
              account security should not be shared with anybody else or
              carelessly stored or disclosed under any circumstance.
            </li>
            <li className="my-2">
              If you leave your Electronic Access Device without logging out,
              write your PIN down in a public space, or share your details with
              anybody, we will not be liable for any errors, or results that may
              come of it.
            </li>
            <li className="my-2">
              We will always use all reasonable efforts to keep the App and
              service safe, and your security settings will help us narrow it
              further down. However, if these issues arise due to carelessness
              with any part of your app or account security, there is very
              little we can do, and we will be relieved of any liability as
              regards the occurrence of a breach.
            </li>

              If you believe or reasonably suspect that there is a fraudulent
              act, we haven’t caught (which should be easy since you get all
              notifications), it is your duty to notify us immediately. We will
              then investigate and report back to you through the most secure
              channel you provide to us.
            </li>

              Where you notify us of your intention to change your password,

              receive any such request from anyone (even if they are using our
              name and logo and appear to be genuine) then it is likely to be

              to us immediately.

            payments related to purchasing, then the relationship for that

            no way responsible for that purchase, or any terms set by that
            supplier. If you think that a payment initiated through the App may
            have been incorrect, unauthorized, or not properly executed (perhaps
            due to delay or other error), then you need to: contact us
            immediately at info.gdl.ng.com so that we can investigate and stop
            the payment if possible.
